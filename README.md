#Javascript Memory Game

##Learning from Challenges

Facing technical challenges taught me to troubleshoot and think creatively, improving my problem-solving skills.

##Overcoming Timer Issues

I struggled with setting up the timer correctly, but with help from my teacher and classmates, I managed to make it work in the end.

##Next Steps

If I had more time or skills, I would implement additional difficulty levels, a presentation page to introduce the game, and a means to share it with others.
Additionally, I would explore options to allow users to customize the game to their preferences.
